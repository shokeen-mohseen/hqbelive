      <p>Our Services enable you to search for various beverages including alcoholic beverages and related experiences, and
        such other products as may be added by HQbe from time to time ("Product(s)") and place reservations of the orders
        which shall be placed and scheduled with our merchants/bar/restaurant/club/Pub/hotel partners ("Partners"). All Reservations
        placed through the Website or App are accepted, reviewed, and ultimately fulfilled by the Partners. You acknowledge
        and agree that you are only Reserving your preferred Products on the App and/ or Website and you are not completing
        a sale and purchase transaction of the same on the App and/ or the Website, but only requesting for booking/ reservation.
        All sale and purchase transactions are solely made between you and the Partners.</p>
      <p>You acknowledge and agree that HQbe does not sell, offer to sell, invite to sell, or solicit any offers but merely
        acts a facilitator to reserve the Products at the respective Partner outlet. In all instances, all sales are promoted,
        accepted, made and delivered by licensed retailers/outlets who receive all orders and offers. No part of the Services
        is intended to facilitate any improper furnishing of inducements by any manufacturer, importer, supplier, wholesaler

        not expressly granted herein are reserved by HQbe.</p>
      <h3>Processing and Delivery of Products</h3>
      <p>
        HQbe provides a tool for our Partners to display their Products on our App and Website through which the HQbe user may reserve
        a particular Product. Our App and Website provides a platform through which all Reservations of Products are processed.
        No payments are to be made / received to HQbe through the App. All Users are required to process the order base amount
        thru the third party payment gateway and all payments in respect of the Products which are Reserved may be made through
        such third party payment gateway, the monetary value of which will be received by the respective Partner from whom
        the App user redeems the Product. At the time you Reserve Products on the App, payments will be charged through a
        third party payment gateway, which will, subject to the terms and conditions agreed with the payment gateway of these
        Terms, transfer and deliver the funds to the Partners. Please note that a Reservation of a Product does not constitute
        actual purchase of such Product, at any point of time. In fact, a User is free to cancel such Reservation or not
        redeem such Product from the Partner. Only at the time of syncing of the User's respective reservation PIN with the
        Partner's dashboard, i.e. at the time of Redemption / pick-up of the Product, is the transaction complete, with transfer
        of funds to the Partner’s account and along with that App User agrees to pay the Partner towards the applicable taxes
        against the reserved product.
        <br/>
        <br/> Neither HQbe, nor any officer, director, employee, shareholder or agent of HQbe shall be liable to the User or any
        third-party for any claims relating to the reservation, delivery and/or consumption of the Product or any consequences
        which may result thereof.
        <br/>
        <br/> By completing a Reservation through the App, you agree that you are of the relevant legal age as per Applicable
        Law in the State in which you are domiciled, to reserve and thereafter consume such Products and you will be present
        to accept the delivery of Products.
        <br/>
        <br/> In the event that there is no individual who is of the relevant legal age as per Applicable Law in the State in
        which he is domiciled, to Reserve and thereafter consume such Products or such individual cannot provide valid identification
        showing the proof of his or her age or other excise prerequisites such as "permit", the Partner may deny service
        and/or delivery of the Products.
        <br/>
        <br/> The Partners reserve the right to refuse to deliver Products for any reason. This reservation includes, but is not
        limited to, refusing service to individuals who are visibly intoxicated in the interest and safety or by policy on
        admission rights. Once the transaction is completed between the Partner and the HQbe App user, the rights on the
        Products solely lie with the HQbe App user.
